# Approximation-Theory
 Following the book "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice" by Trefethen in Numpy Python instead of Matlab.
 
 Doing it on Jupyter Notebooks to follow the spirit of the book.
 
 Not using neither
 [pychebfun](https://github.com/olivierverdier/pychebfun)
 nor
 [chebpy](https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy)
 since my aim is to use standard NumPy instead.
 They fun though.
