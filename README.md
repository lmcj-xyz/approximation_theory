# Approximation-Theory
 Following the book "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice" by Trefethen in Numpy Python instead of Matlab.
 
 Doing it on Jupyter Notebooks to follow the spirit of the book.
 
 Not using neither
 [pychebfun](https://github.com/olivierverdier/pychebfun)
 nor
 [chebpy](https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy)
 since my aim is to use standard NumPy instead.
 They seem great though.

**IMPORTANT (I guess ü§∑üèº):** In `requirements.txt` you will find:
- `jupyterlab-vim`. If you don't use/like vim, then remove it from the requierements or change it in the settings of JupyerLab.
- `jupyterlab-language-pack-es-ES`. If you don't want your interface in spanish then just don't change that in your settings, or remove this package from the requirements.
